# Test Automation Engineer - technical task

In addition to the interview we would like to send you a task to understand better your automated testing background.

We would like you to create automated test cases for pages at our public website as it shares some of the features with our main product. Task details are described below.

The pages to use for the task:
https://www.xeneta.com/demo
https://www.xeneta.com/careers

* Prepare a list of functional checks you'd perform on the pages above
* Decide on a few test cases to automate from this list (would be nice if you can elaborate on why you've chosen these exact test cases)
* Select a tool/technology to use for test automation
* Create automated tests that are resistant to changes in the UI

## Assumptions

- Top and bottom bars with links to sign in, resources, knowledge base and so on just need to be there, there is no need to check if the elements work or pages exist
- If there are links to another pages inside the page body, they have to be checked (as in, they are links and they lead where it says they should), but the destination pages are not to be covered with checks
- Xeneta Bot is not to be covered with checks either

## About the format the task solution should be provided:

* There should be a list of checks for both pages with explanation on which checks were selected for test automation
* We should be able to run the tests you'll create 
* There should be instructions provided on how to run them, as few as possible
* We should have access to code/modules/etc that do the automated testing

We don't have a hard deadline, but let us know please when you'll be able to work on the task. Feel free to ask questions if any.

## Extra details
- Keep your solution in a Version Control System of your choice. Provide the solution as a public repository that can be easily cloned by our development team.
- Provide any instructions needed to set up the system in README.md
